# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web application that integrates with the Donghaeng Lottery website. It provides users with a way to access the lottery site and includes internationalization features.

## Styles, Designs, and Features

*   **Main Page:** `index.html` serves as the entry point.
*   **Styling:** `style.css` for visual presentation.
*   **Functionality:** `main.js` for client-side logic.
*   **Internationalization:** `i18n.js` and `locales/` directory for multiple language support.
*   **Static Pages:** `terms.html` and `privacy.html`.

## Current Task: Fix Donghaeng Lottery Integration and Deploy to Cloudflare

1.  **Examine `index.html` and `main.js`**: Understand the current implementation and identify the problem with the Donghaeng Lottery site integration.
2.  **Fix the integration issue**: Modify the HTML or JavaScript to ensure the site is correctly embedded or linked.
3.  **Set up Firebase MCP**: Create and configure `.idx/mcp.json`.
4.  **Deploy to Cloudflare**: Deploy the application.
